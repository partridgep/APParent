# Functionality
Coming Soon

## User Authentication
This app utilizes Django's built-in authentication functionality provided by the 'django.contrib.auth' app which is included within the 'INSTALLED APPS' list in 'settings.py'

## Signing up as a Parent
The app requires a user to specify whether you are signing up as a parent or a non-parent.  Signing up as a parent will allow a user to register a child and invite other users to be a part of a child's team, i.e. School Teachers, Speech and Language Pathologists, Occupational Therapists, Physical Therapists, BCBA's, Registered Behavioral Technicians, Paraprofessional Educators.

## Signing up as a Non-Parent
As a non-parent, you can only access a child's record if a parent invites you to be a part of that child's team.  You will receive this invitation via email which will allow you to sign up as a user and access the records associated to the child that you are working with.

## Daily Reports
Each user can log daily reports on the child's progress.  Each report logs who created the report, when the report was created and shows a color coded status that indicates the report progress.

## Goals
Users can also create Goals for each child assigned to them.  Each goal logs who created the goal, a color coded status report and the deadline on when a goal needs to be met.

## Meetings
Users can also create meeting invites for each user.  A user can setup his/her availability and other users can only invite users during those available times.
